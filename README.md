# api-authorization-method

A web component that extends `@advanced-rest-client/authorization-method` to add ability to read API security configuration to apply to currently selected type.
The component works with the [AMM](https://a.ml) model generated by AMF parser. After applying `amf` and `security` properties to the element it, if possible, determines what are the authorization settings for the method, and applies default values.

For example, OAuth 2 can be configured in a number of different ways. When the security model is applied to the element it renders only those properties that the API requires to authenticate the user.

## Usage

The component supports authorization methods defined in `@advanced-rest-client/authorization-method` package plus adds `custom` type which corresponds to RAML's [custom authorization scheme](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md/#x-other).


### Applying AMF model

First step is to pass the whole generated AMF model to the `amf` property. It is required to properly resolve internal model dependencies and to properly read keys in [JSON+LD compact model](https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/#compact-iris).

Second step is to extract the correct security definition for a method. It is added to a `http://a.ml/vocabularies/apiContract#supportedOperation` object. The security setting that should be applied to the `security` property has type of `http://a.ml/vocabularies/security#ParametrizedSecurityScheme`.

An example script that applies the values can look like the following.

```html
<api-authorization-method type="OAuth 2" id="auth"></api-authorization-method>
<script>
(async () => {
  const model = await getAmfModelSomehow();
  const security = readSecurityFor(model, '/endpoint', 'GET');
  const method = document.getElementById('auth');
  method.amf = model;
  method.security = security;
})();
</script>
```

The `getAmfModelSomehow()` function can download pre-generated model or run AMF parser directly from RAML or OAS specification.
Then the `readSecurityFor()` function looks for security definition in `/endpoint` endpoint, inside `GET` method.
When ready the values are applied to the element.

The order of setting `type`, `amf`, and `security` parameters doesn't matter as the data processing starts asynchronously. However, if the `type` does not match passed `security` the `security` settings is ignored.

A note on clearing `settings` property. When an `undefined` or any incompatible value is set to the `settings` property, the view won't change. Incompatible value is just ignored. Remove the element from the DOM if no longer applicable, change `type` property to something else, or apply new `settings` with the new values.

### Installation

```bash
npm install --save @advanced-rest-client/api-authorization-method
```

### In an html file

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script type="module">
      import '@advanced-rest-client/api-authorization-method/api-authorization-method.js';
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <api-authorization-method></api-authorization-method>
  </body>
</html>
```

### In a LitElement

```js
import { LitElement, html } from 'lit-element';
import '@advanced-rest-client/api-authorization-method/api-authorization-method.js';

class SampleElement extends LitElement {
  static get properties() {
    return {
      amfModel: { type: Array },
      endpoint: { type: String },
      method: { type: String },
    };
  }

  get security() {
    const { amfModel, endpoint, method } = this;
    return this.readSecurityFor(amfModel, endpoint, method);
  }

  readSecurityFor(amf, endpoint, method) {
    // implement me
  }

  render() {
    const { amfModel, security } = this;
    return html`
    <api-authorization-method
      type="OAuth 2"
      .amf="${amfModel}"
      .security="${security}"
      @change="${this._securityChangeHandler}"></api-authorization-method>
    `;
  }

  _securityChangeHandler(e) {
    console.log('current authorization settings', e.target.serialize());
  }
}
customElements.define('sample-element', SampleElement);
```
